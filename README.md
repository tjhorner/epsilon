## Epsilon for AP Stats

This is a fork of the Epsilon operating system with improvements aimed to be convenient for students taking the AP Statistics course. [(The NumWorks calculator is approved for the exam!)](https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/takingtheexam/exam-policies/calculator-policy) I modified it for my personal use, but it would probably be useful for a person or two.

Some of these improvements (so far) include:

- Sample standard deviation in stats tab on Regression app
- Residual standard deviation in stats tab on Regression app
- "Initialize column" function for pairs
  - This fills a column with a specified number of zeros

Some planned improvements include:

- Copying/pasting lists of data
- Saving/loading lists of data
- More lists in stats/regression apps
- Better list integration (e.g. being able to reference `V1` from the calculation app)
- [Some more here](https://github.com/numworks/epsilon/issues/690)

## Original Readme

Epsilon is a high-performance graphing calculator operating system. It includes eight apps that cover the high school mathematics curriculum.
